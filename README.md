# Tribute-html-css
# This is a tribute webpage made by html css for practice.
 :- where I have created an interface/page and added container, content then image container 
    through html for inserting image in it and added sections for elaborating few information 
    about our missile man and a great scientist late Dr. APJ Abdul kalam.

# This content are then formated through css by using link rel attribute in html (which specifieds the relationship between two documents).
  :- In css I have used many properties like margin, height, width, background colour,font,letter- 
     align,text-align give a proper format to the webpage.
THANK YOU!
